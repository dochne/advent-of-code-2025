# Advent of Code 2025!

I normally do this in Ruby, as I *love* how expressive the language is.

However, I've been dwelling this year on the fact that the thing that makes it nice is how well it implements scalar objects.

Well... why can't we have nice things in JS too?

We no longer have quite the same problem space as prototype.js way back when - we can avoid being bitten by `for in`, we're using JS in Node and thus we avoid the whole "we don't know who is using this" problem.

Let's pretend like it's 2005 and make something fun to use.

As such, the language this year is TS and I'll be slowly reimplementing a lot of the standard library from Ruby :D
